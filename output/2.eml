Great questions you guys! :) I'll write a longer version if you guys want=
 to know about it, so please let me know.Sketch is locked into the Apple =
eco-system, and for most developers that want to develop for iOS (nativel=
y), there's no alternative to Xcode, so that's something a lot of the iOS=
 developers just use Mac.I was reading interesting poll results, that mos=
t of the designers use Mac as a platform, and I hope as time progresses t=
hat more and more designers can afford to use the platform.1. Alternative=
s to Sketch - there isn't a straightforward way to say this. You can use =
Photoshop, Illustrator, the deprecated Fireworks (which is very close to =
what Sketch does). So no - there's no way we can ask all designers to use=
 Sketch all the time for everything.2. Specks and passing assets for deve=
lopment. Sketch is great as a platform that is optimized to generate all =
the assets the developer needs super fast. In the case when you want to a=
ctually leave the developer to do all the software building/assets slicin=
g and measurements, there is a great free plugin=C3=A2=C2=80=C2=94Sketch =
Measure (https://github.com/utom/sketch-measure)=C3=A2=C2=80=C2=94that is=
 100% free and generates clickable specification with assets embedded (ht=
tp://ux.utom.us/preview/). This is what we use in the R&D team to communi=
cate design. Our developers do not slice the code, the just open the spec=
ification and get all the numbers & assets from the speck itself.Let me k=
now if you want to know more!

/down freely. It is quick, much quicker than Photoshop, and it resembles =
the working experience with Macromedia/Adobe Fireworks.That said, you're =
not going to miss Illustrator for interface work, but you might want to u=
se it for logo or complex icon work. Unfortunately Sketch is still not ve=
ry well versed for working with vectors. I personally had to run couple o=
f things in Illustrator when I was working on the skill icons. For pure U=
I though, Sketch beats any Adobe application on the market today.I usuall=
y use artboards for all the states of a screen, and then I have pages for=
 each screen in a series of designs. For example, if we have to design a =
web app with log in, profile and dashboard pages, each of those is going =
to be a page (log in, profile and dashboard), and I'm going to end up wit=
h a ton of artboards for each stage of the screen. I usually separate mob=
ile and desktop web. Naming your artboards and pages can be a life-saver =
when done right. You export all the artboards, so building a prototype in=
 InVision becomes really easy.https://drive.google.com/a/appirio.com/file=
/d/0B1LbmKnex41fTFYxN2paMUxHZmM/view?usp=3Dsharing"I rely heavily on plug=
ins to build elaborate interfaces, the 2 most important are "content gene=
rator" and "fluid" https://github.com/matt-curtis/Fluid-for-Sketch . The =
latter is really important when I started work on the new Search & Discov=
er.I use the Fluid plugin to construct a basic template of a card and the=
n I copy-paste the cards, so I can populate them with content. This is ve=
ry close to development, so I have to design only 1 element to be perfect=
, and just populate data afterwards. Gone are the days when I had to manu=
ally move text in repeating elements! I'm really looking forward for Adob=
e Comment, which will be even better, from what I've seen.Here for exampl=
e, I constructed a set of separate text objects and provided constraints =
for each of them, so I could use a separate text style for the clickable =
links and also have the icon between them.https://drive.google.com/a/appi=
rio.com/file/d/0B1LbmKnex41fczhHaWVCbDBLakE/view?usp=3DsharingWhat this a=
llows me is to just type in the new text, and hit "update layout", and th=
e new text will distribute accordingly. Perfect! Guess how much time that=
 takes to do with Photoshop!2. Use of content - I don't think Content Gen=
erator is braking the rules of stock photography, I use it to generate us=
er personae all the time. In a later stage if I want to be really precise=
 with data, I create a "fill with bitmap" style and just copy-paste the c=
orrect data in the form. This is invaluable, as you end up with only 1 ve=
ctor shape that contains the avatar raster data, compared to a smart obje=
ct in Illustrator that is bitmap + mask, or a combo of the same.Let me kn=
ow if you have any further questions!VicProduct DesignerTopcoder R&D

 design. Kind unique enough when all member using Photoshop. Now, I am ab=
out to switch to using Sketch but still I need to reassure myself since I=
 prefer Illustrator than Photoshop and even Sketch which I find it is the=
 lack of some features (eg. align to key object, there a plug-in to solve=
) and basically the different shortcut.I hope you don't mind if I ask you=
 these question:1. What is your workflow designing using Sketch? I've bee=

his thread. 2. There a rules in Topcoder said, All submitted elements mus=

r: Stock PhotographyStock photography is not allowed in this challenge. A=
ll submitted elements must be designed solely by you.See this page for mo=

 use stock art for the persona.I will be very delighted if you like to an=
