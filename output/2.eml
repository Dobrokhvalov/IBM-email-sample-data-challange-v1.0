Great questions you guys! :) I'll write a longer version if you guys want=
 to know about it, so please let me know.Sketch is locked into the Apple =
eco-system, and for most developers that want to develop for iOS (nativel=
y), there's no alternative to Xcode, so that's something a lot of the iOS=
 developers just use Mac.I was reading interesting poll results, that mos=
t of the designers use Mac as a platform, and I hope as time progresses t=
hat more and more designers can afford to use the platform.1. Alternative=
s to Sketch - there isn't a straightforward way to say this. You can use =
Photoshop, Illustrator, the deprecated Fireworks (which is very close to =
what Sketch does). So no - there's no way we can ask all designers to use=
 Sketch all the time for everything.2. Specks and passing assets for deve=
lopment. Sketch is great as a platform that is optimized to generate all =
the assets the developer needs super fast. In the case when you want to a=
ctually leave the developer to do all the software building/assets slicin=
g and measurements, there is a great free plugin=C3=A2=C2=80=C2=94Sketch =
Measure (https://github.com/utom/sketch-measure)=C3=A2=C2=80=C2=94that is=
 100% free and generates clickable specification with assets embedded (ht=
tp://ux.utom.us/preview/). This is what we use in the R&D team to communi=
cate design. Our developers do not slice the code, the just open the spec=
ification and get all the numbers & assets from the speck itself.Let me k=
now if you want to know more!

your questions as much as I can, it is always a pleasure to share my know=

esign process with whiteboarding, sketching on paper, ideation, research,=
 so by the time I go to Sketch I have somewhat of a good understanding wh=
at I can do.Sketch is awesome as UI building/rendering tool. It is 100% v=
ector-based, so the end result is resolution independent, you can scale u=
p/down freely. It is quick, much quicker than Photoshop, and it resembles=
 the working experience with Macromedia/Adobe Fireworks.That said, you're=
 not going to miss Illustrator for interface work, but you might want to =
use it for logo or complex icon work. Unfortunately Sketch is still not v=
ery well versed for working with vectors. I personally had to run couple =
of things in Illustrator when I was working on the skill icons. For pure =
UI though, Sketch beats any Adobe application on the market today.I usual=
ly use artboards for all the states of a screen, and then I have pages fo=
r each screen in a series of designs. For example, if we have to design a=
 web app with log in, profile and dashboard pages, each of those is going=
 to be a page (log in, profile and dashboard), and I'm going to end up wi=
th a ton of artboards for each stage of the screen. I usually separate mo=
bile and desktop web. Naming your artboards and pages can be a life-saver=
 when done right. You export all the artboards, so building a prototype i=
n InVision becomes really easy.https://drive.google.com/a/appirio.com/fil=
e/d/0B1LbmKnex41fTFYxN2paMUxHZmM/view?usp=3Dsharing"I rely heavily on plu=
gins to build elaborate interfaces, the 2 most important are "content gen=
erator" and "fluid" https://github.com/matt-curtis/Fluid-for-Sketch . The=
 latter is really important when I started work on the new Search & Disco=
ver.I use the Fluid plugin to construct a basic template of a card and th=
en I copy-paste the cards, so I can populate them with content. This is v=
ery close to development, so I have to design only 1 element to be perfec=
t, and just populate data afterwards. Gone are the days when I had to man=
ually move text in repeating elements! I'm really looking forward for Ado=
be Comment, which will be even better, from what I've seen.Here for examp=
le, I constructed a set of separate text objects and provided constraints=
 for each of them, so I could use a separate text style for the clickable=
 links and also have the icon between them.https://drive.google.com/a/app=
irio.com/file/d/0B1LbmKnex41fczhHaWVCbDBLakE/view?usp=3DsharingWhat this =
allows me is to just type in the new text, and hit "update layout", and t=
