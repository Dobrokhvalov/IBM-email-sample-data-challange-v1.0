I am using this answer, the ever popular SO post to dynamically load a javascript file:

$.getScript("scripts/datagrid.js", function(){

    alert("Script loaded but not necessarily executed.");                      

});


But the it never loads.  JQuery is referenced in the underlying HTML file in the header before the js file that is calling this script loading function.  Furthermore, I don't call this script loader until after the document is loaded:

$(document).ready(function() {
    administration.init();
});


I have validated that JQuery is loaded already by checking the value of an element that is hard-coded in HTML.  Which is also validated by the fact the script is executed.

The script file exists and works if I add it to the HTML header, but I want to load it dynamically.

Why does the anonymous function never fire (obviously because the script never loads - why)?
