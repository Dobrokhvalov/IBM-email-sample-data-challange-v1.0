Whenever I try to parse a json to an OrderedDict, it ends up in a different order than the json is. I try it like this:

from collections import OrderedDict    
data = OrderedDict(json.loads(resp.read().decode("utf-8")), object_pairs_hook=OrderedDict)


Am I doing something wrong, if so, what can I do to fix it, or is it not possible in python?

I have seen things like object_pairs_hook=collections.OrderedDict but that does not even execute correctly. It can't resolve the refference.
