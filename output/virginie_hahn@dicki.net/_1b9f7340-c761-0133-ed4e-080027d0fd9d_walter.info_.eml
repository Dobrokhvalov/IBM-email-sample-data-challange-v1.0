I have been banging my head with this issue and so finally I decided to ask for help! I am utilizing a non-server-side dataTables within one of my views in my application. Every row element contains a modal in which the user can click on. When the modal is clicked, the user then sees a form where they can update information and click save. Pretty simple. 

However, this table is too large (over 4 thousand records) so naturally I decided to investigate server-side processing. I have already successfully implemented server-side processing in another view similar to the process described in the railscast http://railscasts.com/episodes/340-datatables?view=comments. 

The problem I am having is that I am not sure how to implement a modal with form_tag(meaning I can update attributes) utilizing serverside processing. 

I saw dataTables has an example of using modals within  dataTables https://datatables.net/extensions/responsive/examples/display-types/bootstrap-modal.html but it's for static information.. 

If anyone has ever done this using rails, I would gladly appreciate some guidance and a step towards the right direction.
