Is it possible to query my own app's Core Spotlight indices? I want to avoid re-indexing entries (as they require pulling thumbnails from the network), and am unsure about what assumptions I can make about the state of the index after certain events such as app reinstall, device restore, a user disabling/enabling Core Spotlight results for my app or device, etc.
