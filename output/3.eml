there were lots of SKETCH threads and I was looking the place where I can post my question - and there you go fajar.mln, you have taken it out of my fingers. I use WINDOWS. I am sure many do.

Now, I am about to switch to using Sketch but still I need to reassure myself since I prefer Illustrator than Photoshop and even Sketch which I find it is the lack of some features (eg. align to key object, there a plug-in to solve) and basically the different shortcut.I hope you don't mind if I ask you these question:1. What is your workflow designing using Sketch? I've been reading this link, which I stumble upon after reading on your post in this thread. 2. There a rules in Topcoder said, All submitted elements must be designed solely by you (you can find this on Stock Photography header: Stock PhotographyStock photography is not allowed in this challenge. All submitted elements must be designed solely by you.See this page for more details.There a plug-in to let we use dummy persona for people picture. My question, is it allowed to use that kind of plug in? Since I usually use stock art for the persona.I will be very delighted if you like to answer my two question. Hope to hear from you and have a nice weekend, Victor!Best regards,Erianto Ongko

>Hey Erianto,Thanks for getting in touch! I'd be glad to answer to your questions as much as I can, it is always a pleasure to share my knowledge and experience.1. My workflow for using Sketch:I usually start my design process with whiteboarding, sketching on paper, ideation, research, so by the time I go to Sketch I have somewhat of a good understanding what I can do.Sketch is awesome as UI building/rendering tool. It is 100% vector-based, so the end result is resolution independent, you can scale up/down freely. It is quick, much quicker than Photoshop, and it resembles the working experience with Macromedia/Adobe Fireworks.That said, you're not going to miss Illustrator for interface work, but you might want to use it for logo or complex icon work. Unfortunately Sketch is still not very well versed for working with vectors. I personally had to run couple of things in Illustrator when I was working on the skill icons. For pure UI though, Sketch beats any Adobe application on the market today.I usually use artboards for all the states of a screen, and then I have pages for each screen in a series of designs. For example, if we have to design a web app with log in, profile and dashboard pages, each of those is going to be a page (log in, profile and dashboard), and I'm going to end up with a ton of artboards for each stage of the screen. I usually separate mobile and desktop web. Naming your artboards and pages can be a life-saver when done right. You export all the artboards, so building a prototype in InVision becomes really easy.https://drive.google.com/a/appirio.com/file/d/0B1LbmKnex41fTFYxN2paMUxHZmM/view?usp=sharing"I rely heavily on plugins to build elaborate interfaces, the 2 most important are "content generator" and "fluid" https://github.com/matt-curtis/Fluid-for-Sketch . The latter is really important when I started work on the new Search & Discover.I use the Fluid plugin to construct a basic template of a card and then I copy-paste the cards, so I can populate them with content. This is very close to development, so I have to design only 1 element to be perfect, and just populate data afterwards. Gone are the days when I had to manually move text in repeating elements! I'm really looking forward for Adobe Comment, which will be even better, from what I've seen.Here for example, I constructed a set of separate text objects and provided constraints for each of them, so I could use a separate text style for the clickable links and also have the icon between them.https://drive.google.com/a/appirio.com/file/d/0B1LbmKnex41fczhHaWVCbDBLakE/view?usp=sharingWhat this allows me is to just type in the new text, and hit "update layout", and the new text will distribute accordingly. Perfect! Guess how much time that takes to do with Photoshop!2. Use of content - I don't think Content Generator is braking the rules of stock photography, I use it to generate user personae all the time. In a later stage if I want to be really precise with data, I create a "fill with bitmap" style and just copy-paste the correct data in the form. This is invaluable, as you end up with only 1 vector shape that contains the avatar raster data, compared to a smart object in Illustrator that is bitmap + mask, or a combo of the same.Let me know if you have any further questions!VicProduct DesignerTopcoder R&D

Unsplash is an example of "do whatever you want" CC Zero licence, so those photos do not fall under "stock photo" for me. https://unsplash.com/licenseIn terms of content - personally any sample/filler content is "stock" content, until it is decided what the final copy/imagery is going to be. Those are to be either discussed or posted by the customers.Again: not sure how the rules in TC are in regards to stock photos and free for use photos, so check with @adroc

You export all the artboards, so building a prototype in InVision becomes really easy.https://drive.google.com/a/appirio.com/file/d/0B1LbmKnex41fTFYxN2paMUxHZmM/view?usp=sharing"I rely heavily on plugins to build elaborate interfaces, the 2 most important are "content generator" and "fluid" https://github.com/matt-curtis/Fluid-for-Sketch . The latter is really important when I started work on the new Search & Discover.I use the Fluid plugin to construct a basic template of a card and then I copy-paste the cards, so I can populate them with content. This is very close to development, so I have to design only 1 element to be perfect, and just populate data afterwards. Gone are the days when I had to manually move text in repeating elements! I'm really looking forward for Adobe Comment, which will be even better, from what I've seen.Here for example, I constructed a set of separate text objects and provided constraints for each of them, so I could use a separate text style for the clickable links and also have the icon between them.https://drive.google.com/a/appirio.com/file/d/0B1LbmKnex41fczhHaWVCbDBLakE/view?usp=sharingWhat this allows me is to just type in the new text, and hit "update layout", and the new text will distribute accordingly. Perfect! Guess how much time that takes to do with Photoshop!2. Use of content - I don't think Content Generator is braking the rules of stock photography, I use it to generate user personae all the time. In a later stage if I want to be really precise with data, I create a "fill with bitmap" style and just copy-paste the correct data in the form. This is invaluable, as you end up with only 1 vector shape that contains the avatar raster data, compared to a smart object in Illustrator that is bitmap + mask, or a combo of the same.Let me know if you have any further questions!VicProduct DesignerTopcoder R&D

>>>Hey Erianto,Thanks for getting in touch! I'd be glad to answer to your questions as much as I can, it is always a pleasure to share my knowledge and experience.1. My workflow for using Sketch:I usually start my design process with whiteboarding, sketching on paper, ideation, research, so by the time I go to Sketch I have somewhat of a good understanding what I can do.Sketch is awesome as UI building/rendering tool. It is 100% vector-based, so the end result is resolution independent, you can scale up/down freely. It is quick, much quicker than Photoshop, and it resembles the working experience with Macromedia/Adobe Fireworks.That said, you're not going to miss Illustrator for interface work, but you might want to use it for logo or complex icon work. Unfortunately Sketch is still not very well versed for working with vectors. I personally had to run couple of things in Illustrator when I was working on the skill icons. For pure UI though, Sketch beats any Adobe application on the market today.I usually use artboards for all the states of a screen, and then I have pages for each screen in a series of designs.

Not all members using Mac, CMIIW, but sketch only available for Apple OS right?2. If i'm not wrong, majority of our front end developer might not familiar or have Sketch in their device? what is your suggestions after design challenge finished if we use sketch for the design tools and wants to move on to the next phase (prototype phase)? Thank you.

Now, I am about to switch to using Sketch but still I need to reassure myself since I prefer Illustrator than Photoshop and even Sketch which I find it is the lack of some features (eg. align to key object, there a plug-in to solve) and basically the different shortcut.I hope you don't mind if I ask you these question:1. What is your workflow designing using Sketch? I've been reading this link, which I stumble upon after reading on your post in this thread. 2.

>>>Hey Erianto,Thanks for getting in touch! I'd be glad to answer to your questions as much as I can, it is always a pleasure to share my knowledge and experience.1. My workflow for using Sketch:I usually start my design process with whiteboarding, sketching on paper, ideation, research, so by the time I go to Sketch I have somewhat of a good understanding what I can do.Sketch is awesome as UI building/rendering tool. It is 100% vector-based, so the end result is resolution independent, you can scale up/down freely. It is quick, much quicker than Photoshop, and it resembles the working experience with Macromedia/Adobe Fireworks.That said, you're not going to miss Illustrator for interface work, but you might want to use it for logo or complex icon work. Unfortunately Sketch is still not very well versed for working with vectors. I personally had to run couple of things in Illustrator when I was working on the skill icons. For pure UI though, Sketch beats any Adobe application on the market today.I usually use artboards for all the states of a screen, and then I have pages for each screen in a series of designs. For example, if we have to design a web app with log in, profile and dashboard pages, each of those is going to be a page (log in, profile and dashboard), and I'm going to end up with a ton of artboards for each stage of the screen. I usually separate mobile and desktop web. Naming your artboards and pages can be a life-saver when done right. You export all the artboards, so building a prototype in InVision becomes really easy.https://drive.google.com/a/appirio.com/file/d/0B1LbmKnex41fTFYxN2paMUxHZmM/view?usp=sharing"I rely heavily on plugins to build elaborate interfaces, the 2 most important are "content generator" and "fluid" https://github.com/matt-curtis/Fluid-for-Sketch . The latter is really important when I started work on the new Search & Discover.I use the Fluid plugin to construct a basic template of a card and then I copy-paste the cards, so I can populate them with content. This is very close to development, so I have to design only 1 element to be perfect, and just populate data afterwards. Gone are the days when I had to manually move text in repeating elements! I'm really looking forward for Adobe Comment, which will be even better, from what I've seen.Here for example, I constructed a set of separate text objects and provided constraints for each of them, so I could use a separate text style for the clickable links and also have the icon between them.https://drive.google.com/a/appirio.com/file/d/0B1LbmKnex41fczhHaWVCbDBLakE/view?usp=sharingWhat this allows me is to just type in the new text, and hit "update layout", and the new text will distribute accordingly. Perfect! Guess how much time that takes to do with Photoshop!2. Use of content - I don't think Content Generator is braking the rules of stock photography, I use it to generate user personae all the time. In a later stage if I want to be really precise with data, I create a "fill with bitmap" style and just copy-paste the correct data in the form. This is invaluable, as you end up with only 1 vector shape that contains the avatar raster data, compared to a smart object in Illustrator that is bitmap + mask, or a combo of the same.Let me know if you have any further questions!VicProduct DesignerTopcoder R&D

Unsplash is an example of "do whatever you want" CC Zero licence, so those photos do not fall under "stock photo" for me. https://unsplash.com/licenseIn terms of content - personally any sample/filler content is "stock" content, until it is decided what the final copy/imagery is going to be. Those are to be either discussed or posted by the customers.Again: not sure how the rules in TC are in regards to stock photos and free for use photos, so check with @adroc

This is very close to development, so I have to design only 1 element to be perfect, and just populate data afterwards. Gone are the days when I had to manually move text in repeating elements! I'm really looking forward for Adobe Comment, which will be even better, from what I've seen.Here for example, I constructed a set of separate text objects and provided constraints for each of them, so I could use a separate text style for the clickable links and also have the icon between them.https://drive.google.com/a/appirio.com/file/d/0B1LbmKnex41fczhHaWVCbDBLakE/view?usp=sharingWhat this allows me is to just type in the new text, and hit "update layout", and the new text will distribute accordingly. Perfect! Guess how much time that takes to do with Photoshop!2. Use of content - I don't think Content Generator is braking the rules of stock photography, I use it to generate user personae all the time. In a later stage if I want to be really precise with data, I create a "fill with bitmap" style and just copy-paste the correct data in the form. This is invaluable, as you end up with only 1 vector shape that contains the avatar raster data, compared to a smart object in Illustrator that is bitmap + mask, or a combo of the same.Let me know if you have any further questions!VicProduct DesignerTopcoder R&D

He said that you are big on getting everyone into Sketch. I am currently using Illustrator as my tools for UI and UX design. Kind unique enough when all member using Photoshop. Now, I am about to switch to using Sketch but still I need to reassure myself since I prefer Illustrator than Photoshop and even Sketch which I find it is the lack of some features (eg. align to key object, there a plug-in to solve) and basically the different shortcut.I hope you don't mind if I ask you these question:1. What is your workflow designing using Sketch? I've been reading this link, which I stumble upon after reading on your post in this thread. 2. There a rules in Topcoder said, All submitted elements must be designed solely by you (you can find this on Stock Photography header: Stock PhotographyStock photography is not allowed in this challenge. All submitted elements must be designed solely by you.See this page for more details.There a plug-in to let we use dummy persona for people picture. My question, is it allowed to use that kind of plug in? Since I usually use stock art for the persona.I will be very delighted if you like to answer my two question. Hope to hear from you and have a nice weekend, Victor!Best regards,Erianto Ongko

My workflow for using Sketch:I usually start my design process with whiteboarding, sketching on paper, ideation, research, so by the time I go to Sketch I have somewhat of a good understanding what I can do.Sketch is awesome as UI building/rendering tool. It is 100% vector-based, so the end result is resolution independent, you can scale up/down freely. It is quick, much quicker than Photoshop, and it resembles the working experience with Macromedia/Adobe Fireworks.That said, you're not going to miss Illustrator for interface work, but you might want to use it for logo or complex icon work. Unfortunately Sketch is still not very well versed for working with vectors. I personally had to run couple of things in Illustrator when I was working on the skill icons. For pure UI though, Sketch beats any Adobe application on the market today.I usually use artboards for all the states of a screen, and then I have pages for each screen in a series of designs. For example, if we have to design a web app with log in, profile and dashboard pages, each of those is going to be a page (log in, profile and dashboard), and I'm going to end up with a ton of artboards for each stage of the screen. I usually separate mobile and desktop web. Naming your artboards and pages can be a life-saver when done right.
